# ☀️ Weather App

Weather App is a React-based web application that allows users to search for the current weather and forecast for any city in the world.  
The app fetches real-time data from a public weather API and displays it in a user-friendly, responsive interface.

This project was built to practice frontend development, API integration, and responsive UI design.
